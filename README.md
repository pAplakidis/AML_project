# Brain Tumor Detection And Classification Using Multitask Learning

## Dataset

- [Brain Tumor Segmentation BraTS 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/brain-tumor-segmentation-brats-2019)
- [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

### TODO

- train segmentation model using SegNet
- use active learning to label classification dataset
- solve imbalance problem (segmentation task is oversampled and classification undersampled)
- train multitask model
- train single task models
- classification output as extra segmentation input
- segmentation output as extra classification input
- compare performances (metrics from lectures, task performance, speed, etc)
- write paper
- create poster
