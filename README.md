# Brain Tumor Detection And Classification Using Multitask Learning

## Dataset

- [BraTS2020 Dataset (Training + Validation)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation)
- [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

### TODO

- train segmentation model using SegNet (DONE)
- use active learning to label classification dataset
- solve imbalance problem (segmentation task is oversampled and classification undersampled)
- train multitask model
- train single task models
- classification output as extra segmentation input
- segmentation output as extra classification input
- compare performances (metrics from lectures, task performance, speed, etc)
- write paper
- create poster
